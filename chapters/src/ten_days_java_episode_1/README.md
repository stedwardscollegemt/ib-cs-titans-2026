### 10 Days of Java: Menu-Driven Program [Episode #1]

Welcome to your 10-day Java programming challenge! Over the next two weeks, you’ll learn the basics of Java programming. You will do this while building a **Music, Movie, and YouTube Recommendation System**. Each day, we’ll build on what you learned the previous day, starting with simple code and working up to a fully functional program with a menu and multiple options. By the end of this challenge, you’ll know how to create a menu-driven application that can recommend songs, movies, and YouTube channels based on random selections.

This program will help you practice essential programming skills, including:

- **Displaying output** and organizing content in a simple, user-friendly format.
- **Using input** to interact with users and let them choose options.
- **Working with arrays** to store recommendations.
- **Creating random selections** so that each recommendation is unique.
- **Using loops and conditionals** to control the flow of the program.

Each day will introduce a new concept and exercise to help you build your program step-by-step. By Day 10, you’ll have combined all the parts into a working program that you can personalize and show off!

Let’s dive in, and by the end of these 10 days, you should be comfortable with the programming basics.
