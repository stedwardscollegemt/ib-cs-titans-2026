/**
* Day 9: Loop Menu
* Objective: Use a loop to allow the user to keep using the menu until they choose to exit.
* Exercise:
*      Wrap the menu in a while loop so the user can keep getting recommendations until they select "Exit".
*      Only exit the loop if the user chooses the exit option from your menu.
*      You are expected to do your own research for this task to figure out things we did not cover yet.
