/**
* Day 10: Your Final Program
* Objective: Refactor the code to use Java methods to make your code look cleaner and modular.
* Exercise:
*      Create separate methods for each recommendation category: recommendSong(), recommendMovie(), and recommendChannel().
*      Call these methods from within the loop in main(), making the code cleaner and organized.
*      You are expected to do your own research for this task to figure out things we did not cover yet.
